# IncomeExpense_Calculator

Simple python project where we can see the details and the percentage of our income and the different kinds of expenses in every month.
Here, I have implemented the sqlite to save the data and used the plotly, PIL for the image creation and manipulation. 
Working on the complete CRUD use in the project.
